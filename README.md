# COMPENG-2DX4
This repository holds the code used as part of my Winter 2021 Microprocessor Systems Project Course, where I learned to program an ARM MSP-EXP432 microcontroller. I used ARM-Assembly, ARM-C and Python on a range of peripherals, including motors and a keypad, all building up to the final project of building a LIDAR mapping sensor.
